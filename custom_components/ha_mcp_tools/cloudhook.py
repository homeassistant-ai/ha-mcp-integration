"""Nabu Casa cloudhook support for the webhook ingress (#2696).

Settings → Home Assistant Cloud → Webhooks can expose the in-process server's
webhook at a ``hooks.nabu.casa`` URL. Home Assistant Cloud relays such a call
in-process as ``homeassistant.util.aiohttp.MockRequest`` — no ``read()``, no
transport — and returns only ``response.body`` to the cloud, so a reply on that
path must be buffered, never streamed. Real aiohttp requests are untouched.
