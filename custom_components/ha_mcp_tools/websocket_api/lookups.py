    entry whose ``unique_id`` equals the requested one, optionally narrowed by
    ``domain`` (the entity's own domain, from its entity_id) and ``platform``
    (the owning integration). Multiple matches across platforms are all returned

    their wire strings. In-process, so the read is authoritative immediately (no
