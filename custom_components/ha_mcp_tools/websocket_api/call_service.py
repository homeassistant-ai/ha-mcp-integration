    the single ``async_call`` dispatch, the immediate-match, and the bounded
    confirmation wait — happens in the async :func:`_call_service_prep`, which hands
    the finished result dict in as ``result``. This function only returns that

    step (D2).

    hass: HomeAssistant, msg: dict[str, Any]
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Do all of ``call_service``'s async work; return ``{"result": <envelope>}``.

    The order is load-bearing:

    1. **D1 — authoritative domain block (security-critical).** Refuse
       ``domain == "ha_mcp_tools"`` (case/whitespace-normalized) BEFORE any
       ``has_service`` / dispatch. This is enforced HERE, in the component that
       fires the call, independent of (and in addition to) the server-side guard:
       a component ``call_service`` that skipped it would let a caller invoke the
       admin-gated ``ha_mcp_tools.get_caller_token`` in-process (the server IS
       admin) and then every file/YAML service. The block keys off the RESOLVED
       domain, so it holds no matter which path reaches this function.
    2. **ServiceNotFound** before dispatch, so an unknown service is a clean
       ``SERVICE_NOT_FOUND`` and never a landed-but-unreported write.
    3. Pre-state capture for each ``entity_id`` (a synchronous in-memory read). A
       target whose captured state is ``None`` — absent from the state machine, so
       it structurally cannot ever emit a ``state_changed`` for this dispatch — is
       excluded from the wait entirely (:func:`_confirmable_entity_ids`); waiting on
       it would only burn the full ``timeout`` to learn what the pre-state already
       proved. An ``"unavailable"`` target stays IN the wait (unlike a nonexistent
       one, it can legitimately reconnect and transition mid-dispatch — excluding it
       too would silently miss that), so ``should_confirm`` itself stays keyed off
       the full ``entity_ids`` (intent to confirm), not the narrower confirmable
       subset — a ``validate_first=False`` caller that intentionally skips the
       not-found/unavailable error mapping still needs ``partial=True`` on a
       genuinely-excluded target, not a bare unconfirmed-but-not-partial result.
    4. Register the expected-aware ``EVENT_STATE_CHANGED`` waiter BEFORE the dispatch
       (D5) so a fast entity's event can't arrive before the listener exists, scoped
       to only the confirmable targets from step 3. The waiter confirms only on
       reaching the server's ``expected_state`` hint (skipping intermediate/noise
       events); a ``None`` hint keeps any-first-event confirmation.
    5. Fire exactly ONE ``async_call`` (``blocking=True``); flip ``dispatched``
       immediately after so a post-dispatch problem is never retried as a failed
       call (D3/D9).
    6. Immediate-match (:func:`_match_immediate`) for an idempotent no-op — a target
       whose CURRENT state already equals its hint confirms with NO wait — then a
       bounded wait for whatever is still unconfirmed (D4); expiry is ``partial``.
    7. Diff pre→post into the real transition(s) — the REAL observed transition, never
       the hint value.

    Raised exceptions PROPAGATE — the WS handler turns them into a command error the
    server maps (D7). Two distinct classes propagate: the D1 domain block and
    ``ServiceNotFound`` are PRE-dispatch (they raise before ``async_call``, so nothing
    landed); an ``async_call`` / ``return_response`` validation error is MID-dispatch
    (the handler may mutate state and THEN raise — the documented D9 at-most-once
    residual, NOT pre-dispatch). A confirmation timeout is caught and reported as
    ``partial`` (never re-raised): the call already landed.

    The whole POST-dispatch section — the immediate-match re-read, the wait, and the
    pre→post diff — runs inside ONE ``try`` that, once ``dispatched`` is True, never
    lets a raise escape (I1): a raise mapped to a command error would re-POST an
    already-landed write. A pre-confirmation ``async_call`` failure (``dispatched``
    still False) re-raises so the server can map it; any post-dispatch failure degrades
    to a minimal dispatched-but-unconfirmed envelope. The immediate-match re-read is
    itself raise-proof (:func:`_match_immediate`), the attribute diff is raise-proofed
    (:func:`_values_differ`), and ``unsub`` always runs in the ``finally``.
    Serialization residual (bounded, no sanitize pass): the transition embeds each
    state's ``as_dict()`` and the WS transport re-encodes it; HA core enforces
    JSON-serializable state attributes for its own REST/WS/recorder APIs, so a state
    that reached the component already serializes — re-encoding it here is safe.
